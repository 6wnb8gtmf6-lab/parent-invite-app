# San Ramon Photos - Instructions

## Image Generation Quota Exhausted

The AI image generation quota has been exhausted for today. However, I've prepared the website to easily accept San Ramon photos.

## Option 1: Use Free Stock Photos (Recommended)

### Where to Find San Ramon Photos:
1. **Unsplash** (https://unsplash.com/s/photos/san-ramon-california)
2. **Pexels** (https://www.pexels.com/search/san-ramon/)
3. **Pixabay** (https://pixabay.com/images/search/california-hills/)

### Recommended Images:
- **Hero Background**: Mount Diablo with golden hills (1920x1080px)
- **Community Image**: Modern suburban scene or park (1200x800px)

## Option 2: I Can Add Them Tomorrow

The image generation quota resets daily. I can add AI-generated San Ramon images tomorrow when the quota refreshes.

## Option 3: Add Images Now with Unsplash API

I can integrate Unsplash's free API to automatically fetch San Ramon images. Would you like me to do this?

## Current Design

The website currently uses beautiful gradients in San Ramon colors (blue and amber) which look premium and professional. The design is fully functional and visually appealing without photos.
